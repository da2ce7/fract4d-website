If you're familiar with Python or C++, there's plenty you could work
on, regardless of your level of experience. Some example projects 
could be:

<ul>

<li>
Adding arbitrary precision math support using GMP
</li>

<li>
Compiler improvements such as array support and optimizations
</li>

<li>
Distributed computation to speed up calculations
</li>

<li>
Improving the UI, such as making a better formula browser
</li>

</ul>
</p>

See <a
href="http://gnofract4d.cvs.sourceforge.net/gnofract4d/gnofract4d/Todo?view=markup">the
TODO list</a> for a longer list of possibilities.  I'm seeking
developers of any level of experience who'd like to tinker with or
extend the program- there's a lot to do!
