<h2>What is Gnofract 4D?</h2> Gnofract 4D is a free, open source
program which allows anyone to create beautiful images called
fractals. The images are automatically created by the computer based
on mathematical principles. These include the Mandelbrot and Julia
sets and many more. You don't need to do any math: you can explore a
universe of images just using a mouse. It runs on Unix-based systems
such as Linux and FreeBSD and can also be run on Mac OS X.

<h2>Why Gnofract 4D?</h2>

In short, I believe it's the one of the best fractal packages
currently available for Linux. It's easy-to-use, fast, and extremely
flexible.
